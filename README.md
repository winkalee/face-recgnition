# Face Recognition Search

This web application allows users to upload photos (1-3) of a person, provide a description, and search for related information on social media. It also includes face inference capabilities to predict changes based on descriptions.

## Features

- Upload 1-3 photos for face recognition
- Provide description of the person
- Simulate search on social media platforms
- Face inference based on description (simulated)

## Usage

1. Upload photos using the file input.
2. Enter a description.
3. Click "Search" to get simulated results.
4. For inference, enter a description of changes and click "Infer Changes".

## Technologies

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- face-api.js

## Running the App

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Note

This is a prototype. Real social media search requires API access, which is not implemented here. Face inference is simulated.
